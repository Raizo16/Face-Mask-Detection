### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt Chart used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables FSAÂ personnel to sometimes adhere to the rules and reach the milestone. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work into several modules, including the project manager's. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own duties and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.
