# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt Chart used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables FSA personnel to sometimes adhere to the rules and reach the milestone. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work into several modules, including the project manager's. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own duties and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

### Scope
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is created to map out all of the necessary tasks and to develop the process that will be maintained and approved for the WBS.

1. Integration of facial recognition software with the cameras to detect and recognize individuals wearing face masks.

2. Implementation of a system that can automatically notify mall security or staff if an individual is not wearing a face mask, or if the mask is not worn properly.

3. Integration of the face mask detection system with the mall's security and access control systems to ensure that only individuals wearing face masks are allowed entry into the mall.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: Incorrect detection of individuals wearing face masks <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: Inability to recognize individuals wearing face masks properly.  |How: False detection of individuals not wearing face masks<br> <br> When: The quality problem is determined during the testing phase|Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the training process until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: High cost of regular maintenance and updates to the system. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: High cost of camera and hardware installation. |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord if the budget exceed threshold.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: Delays in data analytics and integration with other systems  |How: Lack of communication and coordination: Poor communication and coordination among project team members can lead to delays and confusion, and can make it difficult to meet deadlines. <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ensure regular communication and coordination among project team members and stakeholders to prevent delays and confusion..|

### Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM)


|Roles|<div style="width: 150px"> Person In Charge </div>|Responsibilities|
|:-----:|:------:|------|
| Project Manager | NUR FAEZAH |Responsible for overseeing the project, setting timelines and milestones, and coordinating with team members to ensure that everything stays on track. The construction, maintenance, and adherence to the Project Office infrastructure and supporting methods (such as processes, procedures, standards, and templates) that are in conformity with OSI Best Practices and policies are the responsibility of the Project Manager. The Project must also keep an eye on the Project to make sure that it is developing in line with the Project's requirements and scope. The project manager must take corrective action if a problem occurs.|
| Procurement Manager | NUR FAEZAH | The RFP or RFO and other solicitation documents are created under the direction and management of the procurement manager. The procurement manager is in charge of integrating all the parts, guaranteeing consistency and continuity throughout the whole procurement process, and adhering to procurement standards, rules, and regulations. Other departments of the project office may be given responsibility for particular sections. This involves coordinating contract discussions, planning and monitoring the procurement calendar, supervising the evaluation of proposals or offers, and managing vendor selection. The project's contract, rules, and timelines must be discussed with each member by the procurement manager. Additionally, the procurement manager must make sure that no employee uses corporate funds to purchase any linked items. The procurement manager must approve all expenses.|
| Risk Manager | MUHAMMAD ANASS | The project's risk management and tracking, as well as risk reduction and contingencies, fall under the purview of the risk manager. In order to prevent the project from being compromised, the risk manager also supervises the risk management activities of the prime contractor. The risk manager oversees project risk identification sessions, keeps track of prime contractor risk management efforts, manages potential and current risks, maintains the risk management tool, and contributes to division-level risk management activities for risks that cross project boundaries or are out of the project's scope. The project's risks must be identified. As a result, the risk management must record each and every danger so that they can prevent it from happening and take the necessary safeguards.
| Administrative Manager | MUHAMMAD SYAHIR | The Administrative Manager oversees the cost management process, which includes sponsoring cost budgeting and monitoring activities, encouraging communication regarding the financial situation, and making sure the project cost tool and accompanying paperwork are kept up to date. The Administrative Manager also launches corrective action and re-planning initiatives and offers reports, recommendations, and progress updates on the project budget and expenditures, including planned vs. actual data. The administrative manager must make a list of everything that might be included in the documentation form after each process for this project. For instance, the activity report and any cost-related documents. This position is crucial to reduce time and financial waste and to ensure that everyone and everything follows the documentation's standard operating procedure.|
| Financial Analyst | MUHAMMAD SYAHIR| The Financial Analyst is responsible for supporting the Administrative Manager by overseeing and tracking the budget and costs of image colorization projects, organizing/creating budgetary documents like Special Project Reports and FSA Budget Change Proposals, reviewing budget/contract expenditures, and gathering and presenting financial metrics. This entails developing financial management rules and procedures as well as balancing the accounting and cost management processes. |
| Project Scheduler | MUHAMMAD ANASS | The project scheduler's job is to coordinate and manage plan inputs, such as monitoring project progress against the timetable, combining schedules and identifying risks and dependencies, and monitoring progress on the schedules of the prime contractor and the counties. In order to control the system's development progress and prevent unforeseen risk brought on by delays or interruptions in progress, the project scheduler's role is to design the progress flow and follow it. |
| Quality Manager | NUR FAEZAH | The Face-Mask Detection system's quality, as well as that of the Prime Contractor, is under the control of the Quality Manager. The Quality Manager offers insight into the project and contractor business practises by examining process and product activities for compliance with standards and plans. <br><br> The quality manager is crucial to the success of our project since they must assess the system's overall quality and the final product in order for the system to create the output error-free.
