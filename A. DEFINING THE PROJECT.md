# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
The rapid development of computer vision has attracted more attention to the global epidemic Covid-19 to enable human-computer interaction and improve public health services. Due to the rapid spread of the (Covid-19), various countries are facing a major health crisis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an effective way to protect people from Covid-19 is to wear medical masks in public areas. It is very difficult to manually monitor people in public places and detect the face mask in each person who is entering the Lotus mall by using CCTV camera only, which is mainly because the mask itself acts as an obstruction to the face detection algorithm, because there are no face signs in the mask area. Therefore, automatic face mask detection system helps authorities to identify people who is not wearing the face mask because they can be susceptible to infections disease. Our system will implement the use of deep learning to automatically detect face masks of personal entering in the Lotus mall.

In our face mask detection system, a camera will be positioned at the entrance door of each possible entrance. The camera will automatically recognize whether the personal that entering the mall is wearing mask or not wearing mask. In this project, our **main focus will be on the face mask detection and recognition module**. This is the very first step in developing the face mask detection system in Lotus mall. 


###  Customer: Lotus's Stores (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd

### Objectives:
+ To develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not 
+ To develop a system that are able to recognize whether the person is wearing the face mask correctly
+ To develop a dataset that consist of images that showing people that wearing the mask, not wearing the mask and people who wears the mask incorrectly in alarge amount to increase the accuracy of training and testing algorithm of our system so that a more accurate result can be obtained.
