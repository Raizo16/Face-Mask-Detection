### Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement:

Our crew utilises an Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop with an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM to carry out our project.

#### Software Requirement:


<img src="assets/Implementation/Jupyter.png" width="250" height="auto" />

Our team implemented the code for the deep learning module in the programme using Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computing platform, in order to recognise and analyse people who will be entering the Lotus mall. To train and test the given data, we additionally use the face mask detection dataset from Kaggle. More data may be supplied for testing and training so that our system operates more accurately.

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
The proposed neural network is WPOD-Net, which is a type of convolution neural network.

#### Outcomes of the system
2 main steps will be applied in our system, which is license plate detection and character recognition. Given an input image, the first steps are to detect the license plate using Warped Planar Object Detection Network (WPOOD-Net) and regresses one affine transformation per detection, allowing a rectification of the license plate area to a rectangle resembling a frontal view. These positive and rectified detections are fed to an OCR network for final character recognition.
